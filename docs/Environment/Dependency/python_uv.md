[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a is a drop-in replacement for `pip`. It is much faster to install packages. It can also create virtual environments with `uv venv` as a convenience. `uv` may change its API surface in the future as it merges with another tool ([see the blog post](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/2/15/rye-grows-with-uv/)). Like `pip`, dependencies can installed from or frozen into a `requirements.txt` file.
